			<p class="info-text">Along with over 100,000 employees, Google can provide you with all G Suite has to offer. A Gmail customized to your company's domain combined with file sharing and storage with Google Drive is just the tip of the iceberg. G Suite also provides Google Calendar, Google Hangouts, Google Sites and more! In addition to the wealth of services Google has on hand, it also has the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) available for your cloud computing needs. GCP is a great place to deploy Python, Java, Ruby and Node.js applications. However, it is not just for applications, it can also handle databases, networking, big data, security and more all in one place. Lastly, Google has an infrastructure set up worldwide allowing partners to easily set up worldwide accesible operations.</p>

			<p class="info-text">With the creation of a new algorithm called PageRank, which orders webpages based on their link relationships, Google was created in 1998 to become a better search engine able to produce a multitude of results. Within two years, it became the default search engine for Yahoo! In 2006, Google was able to lock down a deal for the popular video sharing website, YouTube, and further expand its service offerings. Another milestone came in the form of one billion unique vistors in the month of May of 2011. Being able to handle and respond to the magnitude of queries Google receives everyday speaks to the durability and stability of Google's many servers. Google also has experience in Artificial Intelligence through DeepMind Technologies which has great successes in the game of Go with the creation of AlphaGo. Google is currently expanding its reach to include gaming services through its streaming program Stadia.</p>
